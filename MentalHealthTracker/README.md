# Use
The main idea behind the mental health tracker is to track your mental health over time, and help provide
insights into improving your mental health. The tracker has a daily entry input widget for user interaction.
There are also reminders around the screen to constantly remind the user of their goals, ambitions, and other
things to improve their headspace. Users can also view stats that compare their most recent entry to the rolling
average over the past x number of days, and shows them the percent change in each aspect of their daily entries.

# Comments
This project isn't fully polished. It was used to learn new languages and concepts and put them into practice. I didn't
focus too much on the UX/UI because I was more concerned about the backing of the code.
