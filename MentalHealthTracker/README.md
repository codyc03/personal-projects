# Overview of Contents
This solution has two projects that encompass my mental health tracker. The point of the tracker
is to input a daily entry, recording statistics related to your mental health. The project keeps
track of daily entries, amongst other things, by using a database. It then displays reminders of things
like your goals and things you are grateful of. The project also uses data analysis to provide
users with insight into their mental health trends.

# Prerequisites

# Installation
There are currently no installation instructions.

# Use

# Comments
This is not my most polished project, and there are a lot of things that I would go back and do 
differently. With that said, I found that this project was a really good learning experience for 
me. I got hands on experience building a project from scratch, as well as introduced myself to a 
lot of new concepts and languages.
