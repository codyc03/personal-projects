# Collection of Personal Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of personal projects, each focusing on learning new languages/tools and developing my 
project planning abilities. These projects are not all extremely polished, as the main goal of creating the projects was
to expose myself to these new concepts and learn without the need for perfection.
