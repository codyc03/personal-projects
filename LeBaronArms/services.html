        At LeBaron Arms, we’re all about creating firearms that stand out — 
        and not just at the range. We specialize in custom engraving services 
        that turn your firearm into a piece of personal art. Whether you’re 
        looking for intricate designs, meaningful text, or bold graphics, we’ve 
        got the tools and talent to make your vision a reality.

        Custom Firearm Engraving
    </h2>

    <p>
        Our bread and butter (or should we say "steel and engraver") is custom firearm 
        engraving. No matter the style you’re after, we bring precision and creativity 
        to every project. From traditional scrollwork that adds an elegant touch to modern, 
        cutting-edge designs that make a statement, we’ve got the expertise to handle it all.
        <br>

        Have a family heirloom you want to personalize? We can engrave initials, dates, or a 
        family crest to add a personal touch to a piece of history. Need a gift for the firearms 
        enthusiast in your life? We’ll work with you to create something they’ll treasure forever. 
        Want to show off your team pride or commemorate a special event? Let’s make it happen. 
        If you can dream it, we can engrave it.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Quality Craftsmanship
    </h2>

    <p>
        We know your firearm is more than just a tool — it’s a reflection of who you are. That’s 
        why we take our time to ensure every detail is perfect. Using state-of-the-art engraving 
        technology and good old-fashioned skill, we achieve results that are as durable as they 
        are beautiful. Our process is meticulous, from the initial design consultation to the final 
        polish. We treat every project as if it were our own.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Personalized Service
    </h2>

    <p>
        We don’t believe in cookie-cutter solutions. Every engraving we do is 100% customized to 
        your preferences. Our team will guide you through the process, helping you choose designs, 
        fonts, and layouts that bring your idea to life. Have a rough concept? No problem — we’ll 
        help refine it. Got every detail planned out? We’re ready to execute it with precision.
