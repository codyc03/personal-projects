# Overview of Contents
This project holds the contents to make a fully functioning AI tic-tac-toe game.

# Prerequisites
There are currently no prerequisites.

# Installation
There are currently no installation instructions.

# Use
Using the program is simple. It follows normal TicTacToe rules and the desired gameplay is obvious.

# Comments
The project doesn't output the final X or O, which isn't a huge problem when the user win's but isn't
always obvious when the computer wins. I tried debugging and fixing this, however after a significant
amount of time invested I decided it wasn't worth it trying to fix this one thing so I decided to move
on to more important things.
