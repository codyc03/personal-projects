# Overview of Contents
This solution has a single project that houses all of the code necessary to create a working hangman
game. The program produces output in a terminal and receives user input in order to guess letters of a 
randomly generated word. The user has ten incorrect guesses per word. The game can be replayed with a 
new word after the end of a previous game.

# Prerequisites
There are currently no prerequisites.

# Installation
There are currently no installation instructions.

# Use
Using the program is fairly simple. Simply run the application and follow the in-game prompts. To guess a letter,
type a single character and then press enter. When prompted with the question asking if you want to play another game,
type yes or no (casing does not matter) and then press enter.

# Comments
This is a fairly simple project. I used it to teach myself Python, as I already knew Java and C#. I simply
used chatGPT to introduce me to the differences between Python and the languages I already knew, including 
the main conceptual differences as well as syntactical differences. I did not follow a tutorial, but found the
idea for the project in multiple Instagram Reels.
